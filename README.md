- 👋 Hi, I’m @EricGuic
- 👀 I’m interested in open source projects, like Peertube, Bitwarden, CozyCloud, etc.
- 🌱 I’m not a developper, but I've successfully maintained a wordpress website, installed a NAS with some Docker container. Hard but I did it ;-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Peertube for now.
